## Dataset for Question 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/imdb-movie-reviews
## Question 1: Algorithm Implementation

  1. Problem Understanding: Carefully read the problem description and constraints.
  Ensure your solution satisfies all requirements.
  2. Code Quality:
  - Write clean and efficient code.
  - Include comments to explain your logic, especially for complex sections.
  - Optimize your solution for time and space complexity.
  3. Input and Output:
  - Follow the input-output format as specified in the problem statement.
  - Ensure edge cases are handled (e.g., empty lists, boundary values).
  4. Testing: Test your solution with the provided examples and additional edge cases of
  your choice.

## Question 2: Machine Learning

1. Dataset Selection: Use the suggested datasets or choose a publicly available dataset
that aligns with the problem.
2. Preprocessing:
- Perform any required data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., handling missing
values, normalization, feature engineering).
- Document your preprocessing steps in comments or markdown.
3. Model Implementation:
- Build the model as per the problem requirements.
- Avoid using prebuilt functions for tasks explicitly requiring custom
implementation.

4. Evaluation:
- Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
- Provide a brief analysis of the results.
5. Visualization:
- Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create meaningful
visualizations.
- Ensure visualizations are clear and relevant to the task.
